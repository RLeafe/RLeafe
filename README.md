I'm fairly new to this Github thing but okay at coding. I'm still learning and probably always will be! Thanks for taking an interest in my collection of rubble.

Here's what I do:

*Please note that this list is purley how comfortable I feel about each thing. You may have a different stance of where my level is. :)*

Engines:
- Unreal Engine (Blueprints & C++) <- Mildly Comfortable | Actively Learning
- Unity <-  Very Comfortable | Actively Learning - Strongest

Langs:
- Java <- Very Comfortable | Still Learning but not priority - Strongest
- C# <- Fairly Comfortable | Actively Learning
- C++ <- Mildly Comfortable | Actively Learning
- HTML / CSS <- Very Comfortable, doesn't mean I'm good. | Actively Learning / Slowly Learning (Mainly when I update my portfolio).

Script:
- JS <- Fairly Comfortable | Still Learning
- TS <- Still learning to walk | Slowly Learning

DB:
- MongoDB <- Can get it to do what I need | Slowly Learning
- SQL / MySQL <- Can get it to do what I need but would rather not. | Slowly Learning but not Priority
