Hi nosey stranger,

I'm fairly new to this Github thing but okay at coding. I'm still learning and probably always will be! Thanks for taking an interest in my collection of rubble.

Here's what I do:

*Please note that this list is what I can do and how I feel about them.
You may have a different stance of where my level is. :)*

Engines:
- Unreal Engine (Blueprints & C++) <- Fairly Confident | Actively Learning
- Unity <- Strongest | Actively Learning

Langs:
- Java <- Strongest | Still Learning but not priority
- C# <- Fairly Confident | Actively Learning
- C++ <- Fairly Confident | Actively Learning
- HTML / CSS <- Very Confident, doesn't mean I'm good. | Actively Learning / Slowly Learning (Mainly when I update my portfolio).

Script:
- JS <- Fairly Confident | Still Learning
- TS <- Still learning to walk | Slowly Learning

DB:
- MongoDB <- Can get it to do what I need | Slowly Learning
- SQL / MySQL <- Can get it to do what I need but would rather not. | Slowly Learning but not Priority
